# EKS-bootcamp-portfolio

Using Terraform automation tool, setting up an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) system for the DevOps bootcamp portfolio. deploying Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), along with the necessary Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) resources.
This system will help streamline deployment processes and make it easy to maintain our portfolio with changes over time. 
After setting up the IaC infrastructure, I will then provision our environment with all of the resources and settings needed to support our portfolio.
Finally, I will add the required security layers and any monitoring tools to keep everything secure and up-to-date.
